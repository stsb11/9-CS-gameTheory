** Recap - Zero-sum game and Pay-off matrix
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:

- A game is called =zero-sum= if the sum of payoffs equals zero for any outcome. That means that the winnings of the winning players are paid by the losses of the losing players. EXAMPLEs of a zero-sum games include poker, rock-paper-scissors and tennis.
- Game theory attempts to determine mathematically and logically the actions that “players” should take to secure the best outcomes for themselves in a wide array of “games.”  
- A =Payoff matrix= is a table used to illustrate the player moves and the outcomes with each possible moves.

- Considering  two toy companies, A and B.  Their profits depending on their decisions on advertising or not.
- The =payoff matrix= of their decisions is as following:

** Learn It:  Nash Equilibrium
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Suppose two cars are driving towards a junction from perpendicular directions
- The light is green for one and red for the other
- If the police would not ticket the drivers, would they want to break the law?
- To help you understand this scenario and possible outcomes, lets watch a short 4 minutes video:

- =A Nash Equilibrium= is a law that no one would want to break even in the absence of external force such as police in the traffic light example or in the ice cream example
- Formally, =Nash Equilibrium= is a state where no players can improve their outcomes by change of strategy as long as others remain unchanged.

- create a payoff matrix for the following scenario:
  - Two cars are meeting at an intersection and want to proceed as indicated by the arrows in Figure shown below.
    [[./img/TwoCars-Crossing.png]]
 - Each player can proceed or move. If both proceed, there is an accident. A would have a payoff of 100 in this case, and B a payoff of 1000 (since B would be made responsible for the accident, since A has the right of way). If one yields and the other proceeds, the one yielding has a payoff of 5, and the other one of 5. If both yield, it takes a little longer until they can proceed, so both have a payoff of 10.
 - Analyze this simultaneous game, draw the payoff bimatrix
